"""Node functions for the LangGraph workflow.

Each function receives AgentState and returns a partial state update dict.
Do NOT mutate input state — return new values only.

LLM REQUIREMENT:
- classify_node MUST use a real LLM call (structured output for intent classification)
- answer_node MUST use a real LLM call (grounded response generation)
- evaluate_node SHOULD use LLM-as-judge (bonus points; heuristic acceptable for base score)
